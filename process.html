<h1>Joining the registry</h1>



<div class="heading_dots"><h2 class="heading_largesize"><span class="heading_left_bg">Medical guidelines</span></h2></div>

<p>
If you are between the ages of 18 and 44, in good health, and willing to donate to any patient in need, please join the registry! <br>
You can check the complete medical guidelines <a href="http://marrow.org/Join/Medical_Guidelines/Medical_Guidelines_for_Joining_the_Registry.aspx">here</a> to make sure you qualify.
</p>
<p>Doctors choose donors who are between the ages of 18 and 44 in almost every case. If you are between the ages of 45 and 60, you can join with a $100 tax-deductible donation to Be the Match.
However, your donation may be better served as a general contribution to help offset the costs of adding more people 18 - 44 to the registry, since they are more likely to be chosen as a donor. You can read more at the <a href="http://marrow.org/Join/FAQs_about_Joining.aspx#over44" target="_blank">Be the Match website</a>.</p>




<div class="heading_dots"><h2 class="heading_largesize"><span class="heading_left_bg">How to join</span></h2></div>

<p>To join, a sample of your cheek cells is collected with a cotton swab. It's completely painless and takes less than 5 minutes. You will also need to fill out some paperwork. Then, your cells are typed and entered in the registry, so that doctors can search for matches for their patients in need of a marrow donor.<br><br> Doctors search for potential donors that match the patient's HLA markers - blood type is not a factor in determining who is a match.
</p>

<div class="heading_dots"><h2 class="heading_largesize"><span class="heading_left_bg">What if you're a match?</span></h2></div>

<p>
On average, one out of every 540 members of the registry will go on to donate stem cells or marrow.<br>If you are ever a match for a patient in need, you'll be contacted for further testing. It's important that you respond quickly! If the further testing determines that you're the best match for the patient, you'll have a physical exam and information session.<br>
There are two methods of donation: peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and bone marrow. The patient's doctor will request the method that is best for the patient.<br>
PSCB donation occurs about 76% of the time. It's a nonsurgical, outpatient procedure. Your blood is removed from one arm, passed through a machine to separate out the blood-forming cells, and returned through your other arm.<br>
Marrow donation occurs about 24% of the time. You will receive anesthesia and feel no pain during the procedure. Doctors use a needle to withdraw liquid marrow from the bone.<br>
Most donors are able to return to work or school within 1 to 7 days after donation. While recovery times vary, most donors report that they feel completely recovered within 2 - 3 weeks of donation.
